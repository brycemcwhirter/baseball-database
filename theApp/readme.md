## Initial Steps

1. Activate the virtual environment in the 'theApp' directory

```bash
. venv/bin/activtae
```

This holds all the dependencies the project will need. 

2. Head into the 'app' directory and run the following command

```bash
flask run
```

This should run the project in your terminal

3. From there, open the local host port in your browswer and you should be able to view the project
